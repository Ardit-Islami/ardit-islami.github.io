## Who I Am

I'm **Ardit Islami**, a First-Class Mathematics graduate based in the UK with a growing focus in **AI, Data Science, and Python development**.

I’ve worked in real-time technical support, solving operational data problems using SQL and dashboards. Now I’m building a future in applied AI — with a hands-on, tool-based learning philosophy that combines reflection, iteration, and project work.
