## ðŸ‘‹ Who I Am

I'm **Ardit Islami**, a First-Class Mathematics graduate based in the UK with a growing focus in **AI, Data Science, and Python development**. I bring experience from technical support roles where I applied SQL and dashboarding to live data problems â€” now pivoting intentionally into machine learning and applied Python.

This site is my living resume and showcase of hands-on projects built using my structured Job Hunt OS â€” a system combining AI tooling, reflection, and project-based learning.
