## Who I Am

I'm **Ardit Islami**, a First-Class Mathematics graduate based in the UK with a growing focus in **AI, Data Science, and Python development**.

Iâ€™ve worked in real-time technical support, solving operational data problems using SQL and dashboards. Now Iâ€™m building a future in applied AI â€” with a hands-on, tool-based learning philosophy that combines reflection, iteration, and project work.
