### Project Overview

This visualization was a personal passion project where I explored Tableau for the first time, working with data from a custom game called **Lineball**, invented by a friend. I participated in the tournament and took on the challenge of creating an interactive dashboard to analyze player performance.

### Game Playlist
This is the official playlist for the Lineballs game, which the dashboard data is based on.

### Learning Journey

Since this was my first serious attempt at data visualization, the project became a deep dive into not only Tableau’s toolset but also the fundamentals of data storytelling and design.  
Some of the key learning moments included:

- **Manual Data Challenges**  
  The data was collected by watching tournament footage and logging every shot manually — a process that taught me the importance of planning data collection for consistency and accuracy. Human error and data cleaning became major tasks, revealing how much effort goes into preparing data *before* any visualization work starts.

- **Feature Engineering on the Fly**  
  Without predefined metrics, I had to invent features during the analysis — deciding what aspects of performance to measure and how to represent them visually. This iterative process helped me think critically about what questions the data should answer.

- **Balancing Design and Clarity**  
  I took a lot of artistic liberty in designing the dashboard, aiming for creativity over convention. In hindsight, I see how more intentional choices around color palettes, chart types, and layout could have made the dashboard clearer and easier to navigate.  
  I later learned from resources like [Tableau’s design best practices](https://interworks.com/blog/rcurtis/2017/06/20/tableau-deep-dive-dashboard-design-visual-best-practices/) and [Tableau dashboard tips](https://www.tableau.com/blog/7-tips-and-tricks-dashboard-experts) how to improve on this.

### What I Would Do Differently

If I were to revisit this project, I would:
- Apply a consistent and accessible color palette designed for clarity rather than aesthetic experimentation.
- Use Tableau’s *Story* or *Pages* features to break up the dashboard into a clearer narrative flow.
- Plan data capture and key metrics in advance to reduce manual effort and potential errors.
- Focus on fewer, more purposeful visuals that tell a clearer story.

- **Game Outcome Analysis:** Explore relationships between player metrics and match results.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Filter by player, round, and other variables.

### Reflection

This project was a valuable introduction to the challenges and craft of building dashboards. It deepened my appreciation for:
- The importance of *storytelling* with data.
- The design decisions that make dashboards effective and accessible.
- The value of upfront planning in both data collection and visualization design.

It remains an important step in my broader journey of working with data and tools like Tableau.
