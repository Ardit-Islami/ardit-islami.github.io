Welcome to my developer portfolio.

I'm Ardit — a former technical support analyst with a First-Class Mathematics degree, transitioning into AI and
data-driven development. This site highlights the projects, notebooks, and tools I've built using my Job Hunt OS — a
structured approach to upskilling, experimentation, and career alignment.

Below are some featured projects. Explore more on the [Projects](/projects/) page.
